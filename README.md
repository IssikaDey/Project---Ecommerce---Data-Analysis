# Project-Global-Hotel-Booking-Demand
This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has from the data.
We will perform exploratory data analysis with python to get insight from the data.

**Motivation :**
We have tried to answer the following Questions
1.	How Many Booking Were Cancelled?
2.	What is the booking ratio between Resort Hotel and City Hotel?
3.	What is the percentage of booking for each year?
4.	Which is the most busy month for hotel?
5.	From which country most guest come?
6.	How Long People Stay in the hotel?
7.	Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?

After that we made the predictive model to predict whether the booking will be cancelled or not
We will:

Perform the Feature Engineering to make new featuers
Perform the Data Selection to select only relevant features
Tranform the Data (Categorial to Numerical)
Split the data (Train Test Split)
Model the data (Fit the Data)
And finally Evaluate our model

**Tools and Libraries Used**
We have used Python 3 to its following packages:
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Sklearn
pycountry
